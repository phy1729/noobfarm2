This is a small list that we would like to thank:
------------------------------------------------

Tom Cuchta - author of RQMS (Rash Quote Management System - http://rqms.sourceforge.net/)
	     His code inspired a rewrite and spawning the code you see here

Mark Walling - Without him, the back end and functioning code would not exist.
	       He also worked on the original code to fix security issues until
	       the new code was ready for production.

Matt Hayes   - Wrote the front end and implemented Smarty (http://smarty.php.net)
	       Hosting the noobfarm.org sites

Fred Emmott  - He helped fix the original RQMS code against security issues and
	       also helped to implement a captcha for quote posting.

Martin Lefebvre - For building/working on the login/admin pages.  Finally, someone stepped
		  up to the plate :D

andarius from ##woodchucks on freenode - Helped Matt with some of the front end formatting for
	       the new web page look.  Although, the bitching, we aren't thanking him for :P.
 	       We also want to thank him for his hand in updating the official noobfarm logo
	       with a cool pull pin.

Everyone from ##woodchucks on freenode - They helped a LOT with the last few pieces of code and mysql calls for the
		rating code.  Thank goodness.. I was going nuts.  -Matt


Thomas York  - General advice about things that had nothing to do with noobfarm code :P
	       Helping Matt to keep sane during a few nights of coding hell.
	       Not to mention, his 80% contribution to noobfarm quotes (no, not quotes he submitted;
	       quotes that are actually him).

Mark and Matt's Wives - For putting up with us during long long long coding nights.  Actually,
	       they have to be worshipped for marrying and putting up with our asses 24/7/365
